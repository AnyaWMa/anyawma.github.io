I am a PhD candidate in Learning Sciences and Technology Design at [Stanford Graduate School of Education](https://ed.stanford.edu/), advised by [Jason Yeatman](https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/jyeatman), [Nick Haber](https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/nhaber), and [Ben Domingue](https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/bdomingu). I am broadly interested in **psychometrics**, **reading**, and **human-centered AI**, with a specific emphasis on their applications in improving the future of special education.

In 2023, I was awarded as the [Stanford Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellow](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sigf/fellows/2023). My current research, as part of [Rapid Online Assessment of Reading](https://roar.stanford.edu/), aims to create advanced dyslexia screening and monitoring tools. In one aspect of my work, I develop an open-source library, [jsCAT](https://github.com/yeatmanlab/jsCAT), enabling real-time, browser-based computerized adaptive testing for broad application in behavioral research. At the same time, I explore the potential of leveraging generative AI, assessment data, and human expertise to scale and diversify the item bank of reading assessments. This involves employing psychometric methods to evaluate the relevance, difficulty, and reliability of the generated items, using the evaluation results to provide feedback for improved item generation. This innovation will provide teachers with a more efficient means of identifying and supporting struggling readers, further the research on dyslexia, and lead to positive policy changes.

Prior to Stanford, I was a middle school Chemistry teacher in Brooklyn, NY. My previous research focused on science education and learning analytics under the guidance of [Susan Kirch](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Susan-Kirch), [Camillia Matuk](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/people/camillia-matuk), and [Ryan Baker](https://www.gse.upenn.edu/academics/faculty-directory/baker).
